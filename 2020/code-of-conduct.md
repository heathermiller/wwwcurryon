title: Code of Conduct
---

Nobody likes a jerk, so please show respect for those around you. This applies
to both in-person and online behavior.

The central goal of a conference is to encourage the open exchange of ideas
through free expression. This requires an environment that enables all to
participate without fear of harassment.

Curry On is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion
(or lack thereof).

All communication should be appropriate for a technical audience, including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, innuendo, and imagery
is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
value your attendance.

Our Code of Conduct is derived with thanks from the Codes of Conduct produced
by the ACM, SNAPL, PNW Scala, NE Scala, and the Geek Feminism Wiki.
