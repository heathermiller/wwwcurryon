Curry On began as an academic event, associated with a top academic
programming languages conference ([ECOOP](http://2020.ecoop.org)). As such,
roughly half of participants are expected to hail from top universities all
over the world, and half are expected to be talented and forward-thinking
software developers from continental Europe. Both represent some of the best
and brightest in computer science and software development.

If you're looking to connect with some of the brightest minds in software
development, or just to connect with influential people in software, Curry On
is a great place to start.

There are two ways of sponsoring Curry On.

1. Select a [sponsorship level](#sponsorship-levels) (bronze, silver, gold, or platinum).
2. Select [individual aspects of the event that you would like to support](#la-carte-sponsorship), such as video recording.
